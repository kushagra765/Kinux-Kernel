# Creating your own OS
To create your own basic os based on this kernel, you need to implement these things:

1. Boot Files (In Assembly)
2. GDT
3. IDT
4. ISR
5. IRQ
6. Keyboard, Port, VGA Drivers
7. A shell
8. Filesystem (If you want)

You can implement the supported things from this kernel. As you can see the Kinux Kernel does not support a filesystem, irq and a shell, so you need to implement these things.

Note: ***IRQ will be added soon.***
